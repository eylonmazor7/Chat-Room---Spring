    <p>
        In this exercise we have been asked to build some sort of a chat website. <br>
        The welcome page will contain a text box where the user will enter its username. <br>
        Every try to put a URL which is wrong or belong to a different page will cause a redirecting to the login page. <br>
        After entering a username which is not currently in use, the user will be forwarded to the chat page. <br>
        The chat will present the last five messages sent by the users. The page will also contain a list of current online users. <br>
        An inactive user (for 600 seconds) will be automatically disconnected and sent back to login page. <br><br>

        The last five messages and the active users list will be updated every ten seconds.<br>
        Every user could send a message at the box displayed at the page. <br><br>

        There will be a link to the search page, which will contain two searching options- by username and by text. <br>

        We have used Thymeleaf to update the html page when loading the page. <br>
        There's a use of an SQL database for storing and pulling data (messages and usernames).<br><br>
        Two kinds of Beans took place in our project - <br>
        1. Application level Bean- used to manage the list of users and update it. Will be created only once, when the application start its running.<br>
        2. Session level Bean- used to represent a user.

            My Java packages:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Package beans</b>
                    <p><u>Class UserBeansA</u> - this class represent session scope of each user that login.
                    In this session, we save all the data about the user.</p>
                    <p><u>Class UserOnlineA</u> - this class represent application scope.
                    In this class we manage the users status, and save the online users in map with the last time
                    they do some action (after 60 seconds inactivity the user will be disconnected).</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Package Controller</b>
                    <p><u>Class ApiController</u> - this controller responsible to update the DB, and send update to the
                        users of who still online and the last messages. </p>
                    <p><u>Class Errors</u> - The controller catches wrong URLs. </p>
                    <p><u>Class MainController</u> - this controller responsible to manage the user navigation between pages,
                        and get new users.</p>

                <li><b>Package DB</b>
                    <p><u>Class ChatMessage</u> - This class represent the our SQL table.
                        The Entity annotation represent work with a database.</p>
                    <p><u>Interface ChatInter</u> - this interface allow us to retrieving data from the data base using queries.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Package HttpHelpers</b>
                    <p><u>Class ReqMes</u> - This class represent every user request for a text search. </p>
                    <p><u>Class ResMes</u> - This class represent our response message for the client.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Bean Configuration</b>
                    A configuration file that determines which configuration level will be assigned for the beans.
